## WrongPathError

[[find in source code]](https://github.com/katunilya/mona/blob/main/mona/handlers/route.py#L5)

```python
class WrongPathError(ContextError):
    def __init__(ctx: HTTPContext, path: str) -> None:
```

`HTTPContext` is handled via wrong handler based on path mismatch.

## ci_route

[[find in source code]](https://github.com/katunilya/mona/blob/main/mona/handlers/route.py#L57)

```python
def ci_route(path: str) -> HTTPHandler:
```

`HTTPContext` handler that processes ctx only on right path.

Request path must be case-insensitive to path passed as an argument to the handler
HOF. In order to keep them of the same format paths (bth in request and in handler)
are striped from leading and trailing "/".

## ci_subroute

[[find in source code]](https://github.com/katunilya/mona/blob/main/mona/handlers/route.py#L77)

```python
def ci_subroute(path: str) -> HTTPHandler:
```

`HTTPHandler` that proceeds only when Request path starts with passed path.

Leading part of the path is removed after processing the request. For example
request path was "group/users". Subroute waited for "group". After processing this
handler `HTTPContext` will have "users". Route is case-insensitive.

## route

[[find in source code]](https://github.com/katunilya/mona/blob/main/mona/handlers/route.py#L16)

```python
def route(path: str) -> HTTPHandler:
```

`HTTPContext` handler that processes ctx only on right path.

Request path must be exactly the same as path passed as an argument to the handler
HOF. In order to keep them of the same format paths (bth in request and in handler)
are striped from leading and trailing "/".

## subroute

[[find in source code]](https://github.com/katunilya/mona/blob/main/mona/handlers/route.py#L36)

```python
def subroute(path: str) -> HTTPHandler:
```

`HTTPHandler` that proceeds only when Request path starts with passed path.

Leading part of the path is removed after processing the request. For example
request path was "group/users". Subroute waited for "group". After processing this
handler `HTTPContext` will have "users".
